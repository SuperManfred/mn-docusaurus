import helloworld from "/static/img/helloworld.png";

In this exercise we are going to use terminal to create a folder with three files, and VSCode write some code in those files.

### 1. Create a project directory

A "directory" is a folder that your "project" lives within. We are going to create a project called "my-website".

Open your terminal, navigate to the location you want to setup your project, then enter these commands:

```
mkdir my-website
cd my-website
code .
```

:::info

- first command `mkdir my-website` will _make a directory_ called "my-website"
- second command `cd my-website` will _change directory_ (navigate) into my-website
- third command `code .` opens VSCode with the contents of the directory path (in this case my-website)

### 2. Create a file

Now let's create a file and called "index" with ".html" filename extension. In your terminal enter this command:

```
touch index.html
```

### 3. Write some code

In VSCode open the index.html file and enter the following code:

```powershell title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>hello world</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

:::info

- the first element `<!DOCTYPE html>` lets the browser know its parsing html
- the `<html></html>` tags wrap all other tags to create html elements
- the `<head></head>` tags wrap the information to go in the page head
- the `<body></body>` tags wrap `<p></p>` tags to create a paragraph element

:::

Now save the file, and open it in chrome

<img src={helloworld} alt="hello world" />
