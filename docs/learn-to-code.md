Learning to code can be both challenging and rewarding... but if you're just starting out it will be mostly challenging. It is helpful to set your expectations early.

It is normal skip around trying things out and continually getting stuck with things not working. Sometimes you can't even begin to follow along some exercise because you're missing dependencies, or something is not configured right, sometimes important instructions are not made explicit. Getting stuck can be extrodinarily time consuming and frustrating. The good news is: this does not mean you're not uniquely unsuitable to learn computer programming even though you may feel that way sometimes. Pretty much all developers go through this, it is completely normal.

Fortunately, there are ways to make it a little easier: learn along with resources that are well documented, find a path that helps you understand without getting lost. Impliment what you learn immediately, and repeatedly.

Don't expect that you need to fully understand or recall from memory how to do everything you're learning. It is normal to refer back to some documentation to know how to do something. Be patient. Be determined. Be consistant. Return to your screen, do a little bit more and go a little further, each day, if possible.

To help you get you started I would like to share some things I've learned so far, and show a path you can follow along to learn the basics of software development. There is nothing for sale, you won't have to spend any money on any tools or resources. You can also reach out to me if you get stuck, or if you find something that isn't working.

## The Mission:

You will be able to develop a website, from scratch, and depoy it live to the internet!
