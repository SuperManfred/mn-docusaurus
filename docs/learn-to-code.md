Learning to code _can be_ both challenging and rewarding... if you stick with it. (TLDR: just stick with it!)

While you're just starting out, most of the time it will be challenging! It's helpful to set your expectations early.

It's normal skip around trying things out and continually getting stuck with things not working. Sometimes you can't even begin to follow along some exercise because you're missing dependencies, or something is not configured right on your computer. Sometimes documentation is out of date, or important instructions are just not made explicit. Getting stuck can be extrodinarily time consuming and frustrating.

The good news is: this does not mean you're uniquely unsuitable to learn computer programming, although you may feel that way sometimes. Pretty much all developers go through this, it is completely normal.

Don't expect that you need to fully understand or recall from memory how to do everything on the first go when you're learning. It's totally normal to refer back to documentation to figure out how to do something, you will always be doing this.

Fortunately, there are ways to make it a little easier: carefully follow instructions of resources that are well documented, impliment what you learn immediately and repeatedly, try to make time to code every day (even if only for 20mins). Its not just about spending time practicing, its important to focus on comprehension of what you're learning. Find a structured path, and stick with it!

Be patient. Be determined. Be consistant.

To help you get you started I'm sharing a path for you to get a taste of the basics of software development, hopefully enough for you to get hooked. Hopefull enough for you to be able to continue on the journey, on your own path.

There is nothing for sale here, you won't have to spend any money on any tools or resources (yet). You can reach out to me if you get stuck, or if you find something that isn't working, or if you just have general questions or feedback.

## The Mission:

You will be able to develop a website, from scratch, depoy it live to the internet, and iterate on it to improve it!

### Overview

Here's an overview of what we will cover:

#### Setup your tools

- terminal / bash
- text editor and browser
- version control

#### Create a project

- make a directory
- touch HTML file
- add CSS style

#### Add Git version control

- initialise Git in your project
- create a GitHub user account
- configure project repository

#### Deploy your website

- commit your code
- deploy your project
- iterate CI CD cycle
