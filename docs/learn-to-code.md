Learning to code can be both challenging and rewarding... but if you're just starting out it will be mostly challenging. It is helpful to set your expectations early.

It is normal skip around trying things out and continually getting stuck with things not working. Sometimes you can't even begin to follow along some exercise because you're missing dependencies, or something is not configured right, sometimes important instructions are not made explicit. Getting stuck can be extrodinarily time consuming and frustrating. The good news is: this does not mean you're not uniquely unsuitable to learn computer programming, although you may feel that way sometimes. Pretty much all developers go through this, it is completely normal.

Don't expect that you need to fully understand or recall from memory how to do everything you're learning. It is normal to refer back to documentation to figure out how to do something.

Fortunately, there are ways to make it a little easier: carefully follow instructions of resources that are well documented, impliment what you learn immediately and repeatedly, try to make time to code every day (even if only for 20mins).

Be patient. Be determined. Be consistant.

To help you get you started I would like to share some things I've learned so far, I'll show a path to get started learning the basics of software development. There is nothing for sale, you won't have to spend any money on any tools or resources. You can also reach out to me if you get stuck, or if you find something that isn't working.
