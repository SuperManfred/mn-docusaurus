In this exercise we are going to use the tools we just installed to create a folder with three files, and write some code in those files.

### 1. Create project directory

A "directory" is a folder that your "project" lives within. We are going to create a project called "my-project".

Open your terminal, navigate to the location you want to setup your project, enter these commands:

```powershell title="terminal~$"
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
code .
```

:::info

- first command `mkdir my-project` will _make a directory_ called "my-project"
- second command `cd my-project` will _change directory_ (navigate) into my-project
- third command `code .` opens VS Code with the contents of the directory path (in this case my-project)

### 2. Create files

We are going to create

```powershell title="terminal~$"
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
code .
```
