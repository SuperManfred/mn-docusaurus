## Step 1: Generate a new Docusaurus site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the classic template:

```shell
npx @docusaurus/init@latest init my-docusaurus-site classic
```

## Step 2: Start your Docusaurus site

Run the development server in the newly created `my-docusaurus-site` folder:

```shell
cd my-docusaurus-site

npx docusaurus start
```

Docusaurus website is running at: http://localhost:3000/

Open `docs/getting-started.md` and edit some lines. The site reloads automatically and display your changes.
