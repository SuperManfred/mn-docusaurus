The tools you'll use to develop software continue to improve and become more accessible. It doesn't take much to get started, so lets take a look at what you'll use:

- [Terminal](#1-install-terminal)
- [Chrome Browser](#2-install-chrome)
- [Visual Studio Code](#3-install-visual-studio-code)
- [Git](#4-setup-git)

## 1. Install Terminal

Terminal is a command line interface (CLI) that provides deep customization and command of your computer, this is very handy for developers.
